# Electoral Bonds

## Published by Election Commission of India. March, 21, 2024

On March 21, 2024, the Election Commission of India publicly released the Electoral Bonds data obtained from the State Bank of India (SBI). I found it rather astonishing when SBI communicated to the Supreme Court of India their requirement for a four-month duration to reconcile the purchasers of Electoral Bonds with the corresponding recipient political parties, especially considering that such a task could conceivably be completed in a fraction of that time, possibly within a matter of hours.

Data Summary - April, 2019 - February, 2024
