# Electoral Bonds

## Published by Election Commission of India. March, 21, 2024

On March 21, 2024, the Election Commission of India publicly released the Electoral Bonds data obtained from the State Bank of India (SBI). I found it rather astonishing when SBI communicated to the Supreme Court of India their requirement for a four-month duration to reconcile the purchasers of Electoral Bonds with the corresponding recipient political parties, especially considering that such a task could conceivably be completed in a fraction of that time, possibly within a matter of hours.

## Data Summary - April, 2019 - February, 2024

The findings derived from correlating the Purchaser (Corporates/Individuals) with the Party Dataset are as follows:
- A sum of Rs. 623.21 Cr is absent from the Purchaser Dataset.
- There are 1680 transactions that lack any association with the Purchaser Dataset.
- Within the Purchaser Dataset, 130 transactions involving Bonds have expired.

## Electoral Bonds

- The subsequent charts illustrate the data from both the Purchasers' (Corporates/Individuals) and Parties' perspectives. Of particular interest is the absence of data amounting to Rs. 613.58 Cr from the Purchasers' dataset, where both the corresponding Bond-Number and Purchaser information are conspicuously absent.
- A significant majority, 95.56%, of the sold Bonds hold a denomination of Rs. 1 Cr, totaling Rs. 12,207 Cr out of the overall Rs. 12,769 Cr that parties have encashed. This indicates that donating substantial sums to political parties is considerably more straightforward when utilizing the Rs. 1 Cr denomination.
