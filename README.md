# Electoral Bonds

## Published by Election Commission of India. March, 21, 2024

On March 21, 2024, the Election Commission of India publicly released the Electoral Bonds data obtained from the State Bank of India (SBI). I found it rather astonishing when SBI communicated to the Supreme Court of India their requirement for a four-month duration to reconcile the purchasers of Electoral Bonds with the corresponding recipient political parties, especially considering that such a task could conceivably be completed in a fraction of that time, possibly within a matter of hours.

### Electoral Bonds
Electoral Bonds are a financial instrument introduced in India as a means of making political donations transparent while ensuring the anonymity of the donor. These bonds are essentially bearer instruments, similar to promissory notes, that can be purchased from specified branches of authorized banks for making donations to registered political parties.

### Key features of Electoral Bonds include:
- Anonymity: The identity of the donor is kept confidential, as the bonds do not carry the name of the purchaser.
- Legal Tender: Electoral Bonds are legal tender and can be used by political parties to receive donations.
- Validity Period: These bonds have a limited validity period, typically 15 days, during which they can be utilized to make donations.
- Specified Banks: Electoral Bonds can only be purchased from authorized banks as notified by the government.
- Eligible Recipients: Only political parties registered under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, are eligible to receive donations through Electoral Bonds.

## Electoral Bonds

- The subsequent charts illustrate the data from both the Purchasers' (Corporates/Individuals) and Parties' perspectives. Of particular interest is the absence of data amounting to Rs. 613.58 Cr from the Purchasers' dataset, where both the corresponding Bond-Number and Purchaser information are conspicuously absent.
- A significant majority, 95.56%, of the sold Bonds hold a denomination of Rs. 1 Cr, totaling Rs. 12,207 Cr out of the overall Rs. 12,769 Cr that parties have encashed. This indicates that donating substantial sums to political parties is considerably more straightforward when utilizing the Rs. 1 Cr denomination.
