# Electoral Bonds

### Published by Election Commission of India. March, 21, 2024

On March 21, 2024, the Election Commission of India publicly released the Electoral Bonds data obtained from the State Bank of India (SBI). I found it rather astonishing when SBI communicated to the Supreme Court of India their requirement for a four-month duration to reconcile the purchasers of Electoral Bonds with the corresponding recipient political parties, especially considering that such a task could conceivably be completed in a fraction of that time, possibly within a matter of hours.

### Electoral Bonds
Electoral Bonds are a financial instrument introduced in India as a means of making political donations transparent while ensuring the anonymity of the donor. These bonds are essentially bearer instruments, similar to promissory notes, that can be purchased from specified branches of authorized banks for making donations to registered political parties.

### Key features of Electoral Bonds include:
- Anonymity: The identity of the donor is kept confidential, as the bonds do not carry the name of the purchaser.
- Legal Tender: Electoral Bonds are legal tender and can be used by political parties to receive donations.
- Validity Period: These bonds have a limited validity period, typically 15 days, during which they can be utilized to make donations.
- Specified Banks: Electoral Bonds can only be purchased from authorized banks as notified by the government.
- Eligible Recipients: Only political parties registered under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, are eligible to receive donations through Electoral Bonds.

### Supreme Court - February 2024 on Electoral Bonds

On 15 February 2024, the Court unanimously struck down the Union’s 2018 Electoral Bonds (EB) Scheme. The Bench held that the Scheme violated the voters’ right to information enshrined in Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. The Court also directed that the sale of electoral bonds be stopped with immediate effect. SBI was directed to submit details of the Electoral Bonds purchased from 12 April 2019 till date, to the ECI. This will include details of the purchaser as well as the political parties that the bonds were given to. Further, the Court ordered the ECI to publish the information shared by SBI on its official website within one week from the receipt of the information (by 13 March 2024)

## SBI Data Summary - April, 2019 - February, 2024

The findings derived from correlating the Purchaser (Corporates/Individuals) with the Party Dataset are as follows:
- A sum of Rs. 623.21 Cr is absent from the Purchaser Dataset.
- There are 1680 transactions that lack any association with the Purchaser Dataset.
- Within the Purchaser Dataset, 130 transactions involving Bonds have expired.

## Electoral Bonds

- The subsequent charts illustrate the data from both the Purchasers' (Corporates/Individuals) and Parties' perspectives. Of particular interest is the absence of data amounting to Rs. 613.58 Cr from the Purchasers' dataset, where both the corresponding Bond-Number and Purchaser information are conspicuously absent.
- A significant majority, 95.56%, of the sold Bonds hold a denomination of Rs. 1 Cr, totaling Rs. 12,207 Cr out of the overall Rs. 12,769 Cr that parties have encashed. This indicates that donating substantial sums to political parties is considerably more straightforward when utilizing the Rs. 1 Cr denomination.

### Challenges to the Electoral Bonds

Shortly after the amendments were introduced, in September 2017 and January 2018,  two Non-Governmental Organisations—Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) and Common Cause— and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) filed petitions in the Supreme Court challenging the amendments. At the outset, the petitions argued that the Finance Acts were wrongfully passed as money bills to prevent higher scrutiny by the Rajya Sabha. This challenge is tagged with the larger challenge to the use of money bills under Article 110.

### Election Commission on Electoral Bonds

- On 25 March 2019, the Election Commission of India (ECI), one of the respondents,  filed an affidavit opposing the Electoral Bond Scheme. The affidavit claimed that the scheme is contrary to the goal of transparency in political finance. It also claimed that the ECI had shared a letter to the Union Government on 26 May 2017, warning against the “repercussions/impact on the transparency aspect of political finance/funding.” Further, they submitted that exempting political parties from sharing details regarding contributions would keep information on foreign funding in the dark. The affidavit stated, “unchecked foreign funding of political parties in India, which could lead to Indian policies being influenced by foreign companies.

- On 1 April 2019, the Union government submitted a rejoinder claiming that the EBS was “a pioneer step in bringing electoral reforms, to ensure that the spirit of transparency and accountability in political funding is maintained.” The Union claimed that political parties largely received funds through cash donations, leading to an “unregulated flow of black money.” The Union assured that these issues would no longer hamper political funding because there is only one authorised bank—the State Bank of India—that can issue such bonds. Further, providing KYC details ensure accountability.

### The Challenge in the Supreme Court

- On 12 April 2019, a bench led by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, with Justices Deepak Gupta, and Sanjiv Khanna directed all political parties to submit details of donations, donors, and bank account numbers in a sealed cover to the ECI. The Bench refrained from imposing a stay on the implementation of the scheme stating that “such weighty issues would require an in-depth hearing.” 

- In early 2021, ADR approached the Court seeking a stay on the scheme, before the commencement of a fresh round of bond sales. This application was substantially considered by a Bench led by Chief Justice S.A. Bobde, with Justices A.S. Bopanna, and V. Ramasubramanian. 

- On 26 March 2021, the Bench denied any stay on the application of the scheme. They held that the “apprehension that foreign corporate houses may buy the bonds and attempt to influence the electoral process in the country, is…misconceived.” The Bench also sternly discouraged the petitioners from approaching the Court, stating that “there cannot be repeated applications seeking the same relief.”

- On 16 October 2023, the petitioners approached the Court during mentioning, to hear the case prior to the 2024 General Elections.  A Bench led by Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, with Justices J.B. Pardiwala, and Manoj Misra referred, noting the “importance of the issue” referred the case to a five-judge Constitution Bench.

- On 31 October 2023,  a five-judge Constitution Bench led by CJI Chandrachud, with Justices Sanjiv Khanna, B.R. Gavai, J.B. Pardiwala, and Manoj Misra heard arguments over three days. Petitioners argued that the electoral bonds scheme increased corporate funding, black money circulation, and corruption. They argued that voters have a right to information about political parties’ source of funding, as it informs the policies and views of that party. The Union contended that the scheme was designed to guarantee confidentiality and the right to privacy of the donors, who were otherwise exposed to retribution from political parties that they didn’t fund.

- On 2 November 2023, the Constitution Bench reserved judgement. 
- On 15 February 2024, the Court unanimously struck down the Union’s 2018 Electoral Bonds (EB) Scheme. The Bench held that the Scheme violated the voters’ right to information enshrined in Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. The Court also directed that the sale of electoral bonds be stopped with immediate effect. SBI was directed to submit details of the Electoral Bonds purchased from 12 April 2019 till date, to the ECI. This will include details of the purchaser as well as the political parties that the bonds were given to. Further, the Court ordered the ECI to publish the information shared by SBI on its official website within one week from the receipt of the information (by 13 March 2024).
